#### **Problem Statement**

When the scale of a small business enlarges, it is hard for employers to know employees' quantity, status as well as prepare for approaching red-letter day beforehand through memories or simple calendar function. Therefore, aiming to let employers show solicitude for employees in terms of having a better knowledge of their information and their working status, this system also launches reminder functions like the upcoming birthday or expiration time of certain employees in addition to basic functions. Furthermore, not only can this employee management system guarantee the efficiency of the human source management, but it can also improve employees' satisfaction towards work thus commit more dedication to work.




#### **Problem Setting**

In order to cope with the problem mentioned above, a series of methods are adapted to build up our employee management system thus fulfill the expectation of this project. Within the project, we aim to gather basic information of employees from the user input and help to classify and manage the information. Our employee management system will include several functions below:
Create a new employee record with the necessary information: ID, Name, Gender, Age, Role, Birthday, Entry Date, Expiration Date, Salary and Employment Status 
Search for employees through ID, Name, Age, Role, Birthday and Employment Status
Fire an employee and change his Employment Status
Edit the details of an existing employee
Search for employees with a salary higher or lower than a user input
Allow adding user-defined attributes, the value of a new attribute of the existing employee should be empty or undefined
Work as a reminder to show the upcoming date ranging from some employees’ birthdays to the contract expiration date
Exit the system

When using this system, the user should log in the system with his username and password. Then, a menu will be presented for him to choose the operation. In the end, he can choose to exit the system.

**The attribute of each kind of information is shown below:**

- ID: A 9-digit string
